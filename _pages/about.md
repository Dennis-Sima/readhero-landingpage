# About ReadHero

Hi, I’m Dennis 👋 — and I’m from Austria 🇦🇹

After school, I kept running into a problem:  
I was reading amazing books… and then forgetting them.

All those powerful ideas, quotes, and insights were slipping away, and it really frustrated me. I started jotting down notes in the default Notes app on iOS. That helped — for a while. But after 10+ books, it turned into a chaotic mess. I couldn’t find anything, and the motivation to keep going dropped fast.

In 2021, during my iOS internship, I thought:  

**Why not build something better?**

So I did.

Armed with an old 2011 MacBook Pro (8 GB RAM and a lot of patience), I started building the app I wished existed. I wanted something fast, simple, beautiful — something that felt as good to use as finishing a great book.

Every line of code in ReadHero was written by me in native Swift — no templates, no shortcuts.

But I wasn’t alone on this journey.

My brother helped define the soul of ReadHero. He hand-drew all the illustrations — no AI, no stock art, just pure creativity. The name **ReadHero** and our iconic hero logo? All him. It's a true family project, built with love and intention.
